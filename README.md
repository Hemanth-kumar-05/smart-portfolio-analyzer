### What it is:

A slick, interactive web app where users can input their current investment portfolio and personal risk profile, and get a smart, AI-powered analysis with clear recommendations on how to optimize or rebalance their investments — all explained in plain English using GPT.

# Core Functionalities

### 1. **User Inputs**

* **Personal Profile:**

  * Age, investment horizon (short/medium/long term)
  * Risk tolerance (conservative, balanced, aggressive)
  * Investment goals (wealth growth, income, preservation)
* **Portfolio Details:**

  * List of assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, crypto, gold, etc.)
  * Amount or percentage allocation for each asset

### 2. **Portfolio Analysis**

* Calculate:

  * **Asset allocation breakdown** (pie chart showing % in each asset class)
  * **Risk score** based on allocation vs user’s risk profile
  * **Diversification check** (too much in one asset or sector?)
* Detect **imbalances** (e.g., heavy on crypto but low on bonds)

### 3. **AI-Powered Recommendations**

* Use OpenAI GPT to:

  * Explain the risk level and diversification in simple terms
  * Suggest an ideal portfolio allocation based on profile + market best practices
  * Recommend specific moves (e.g., “Reduce crypto exposure by 10%, increase bonds”)
  * Highlight potential risks or missed opportunities

### 4. **Comparison & Visuals**

* Show **current portfolio vs recommended portfolio** side by side
* Use bar charts or pie charts for easy comparison
* Summary stats (expected risk, returns, etc. if you want to keep it simple)

### 5. **Download / Export (Optional)**

* Let users download a PDF or CSV summary report of analysis and recommendations
* Good for demos and sharing

# User Journey Example (Simulation)

1. User opens the app
2. Fills out their profile:
   *“I’m 28, want growth, moderately risky”*
3. Enters portfolio:
   *“40% Tech stocks, 20% Bonds, 20% Crypto, 20% Gold”*
4. Hits Analyze
5. App shows:

   * Pie chart of portfolio breakdown
   * Risk score: “Moderately high risk due to crypto exposure”
   * GPT-generated text:
     *“Your portfolio is a bit heavy on crypto which can be volatile. Consider shifting 10% from crypto to bonds to balance risk.”*
6. Shows recommended new portfolio pie chart
7. User can download the report or tweak inputs and re-analyze
